    "# Optimal Activity Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the selection of $n$ nonnegative activity levels, denoted $x_1 , \\ldots , x_n$. These activities consume $m$ resources, which are limited. Activity $j$ consumes $A_{ij} x_j$ of resource $i$, where $A_{ij}$ are given. The total resource consumption is additive, so the total of resource $i$ consumed is $c_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} x_j$ . (Ordinarily we have $A_{ij} \\geq 0$, i.e., activity $j$ consumes resource $i$. But we allow the possibility that $A_{ij} < 0$, which means that activity $j$ actually generates resource $i$ as a by-product.) Each resource consumption is limited: we must have $c_i \\leq c_i^{max}$, where $c_i^{max}$ are given. Each activity generates revenue, which is a piecewise-linear concave function of the activity level:\n",

(We have $0 < p_j^{disc} < p_j$ .) The total revenue is the sum of the revenues associated with each activity, i.e., $\\sum_{j=1}^n r_j(x_j)$. \n",
